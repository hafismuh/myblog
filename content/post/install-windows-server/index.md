When I tried to use Windows Server 2025 in VMware Fusion on my Mac, I couldn’t find the ISO file on the Microsoft website. The ISO file must be in ARM architecture so that it can be run on VMware Fusion on a Mac. After watching many videos on YouTube, I found this website, https://uupdump.net/, which helped me to get the ISO file.

Once you have downloaded the package, you will receive a ZIP file, but this is not yet complete. To complete the download, you will need to use Terminal and follow the instructions under the ‘Create download package’ button until you get the ISO file.
