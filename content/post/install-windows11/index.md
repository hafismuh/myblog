I want to start installing Windows 10, but I recently read an update from Microsoft stating that Windows 10 will no longer receive free software updates, technical support or security fixes after 14 October 2025. This means that Windows 10 will reach the end of its support period.

Before installation, ensure that your device meets the requirements. Then, create a bootable drive using the Media Creation Tool and Rufus. If you would like to install Windows 11 directly onto your device, you can use the Installation Assistant, but make sure you back up your data first.

#### Create a bootable using Media Creation Tool
1. Download Media Creation here https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2156295
2. Run the file as Administrator, then select a correct USB flash drive
